Project Description


This project demonstrates the use of Neural Style Transfer, a deep learning technique that merges the content of one image with the artistic style of another image.

Using a pre-trained VGG19 neural network, the program extracts:

Content features from a photograph (e.g., a landscape or portrait)

Style features from an artwork (e.g., a painting)

It then generates a new image that visually combines both ‚Äî preserving the structure of the content image while painting it in the colors, textures, and brushstrokes of the style image.

üîß Key Features
Uses PyTorch and VGG19 for feature extraction

Applies Gram Matrix technique to capture style

Optimizes the generated image using gradient descent

Outputs a stylized image (output.jpg)

üéØ Project Goal
To create a functional script that performs style transfer on any pair of input images, showcasing how deep neural networks can be used for creative tasks in computer vision.

üìÅ Deliverable
A Python script (style_transfer.py) or Jupyter Notebook

Input images: content.jpg, style.jpg

Output image: output.jpg
